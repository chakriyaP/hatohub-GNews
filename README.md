## Technologies Used
This project uses the following libraries and technologies:

- **ReactJS** (with TypeScript)
- **Ant Design** for UI components
- **Ant Design Icons**
- **Axios** for API calls
- **Day.js** for date handling
- **i18next** for internationalization
- **Styled Components** for CSS-in-JS styling


## API Integration
This project utilizes the GNews API to fetch news data. You will need an API key, which you can obtain by registering for a free account at [GNews.io](https://gnews.io/docs/v4?javascript#top-headlines-http-request).

### Data Handling for Published Date
- The API's `/top-headlines` endpoint does not support filtering by `publishedAt`. As a result, the frontend sorts the data by `publishedAt` after fetching it.
- The `/search` endpoint supports filtering by `publishedAt`, but it only allows filtering by category. Therefore, the project uses the `/top-headlines` endpoint and performs the sorting by `publishedAt` on the frontend.

### Pagination
- Since the API's free plan limits results to only 10 items per request, pagination is handled entirely on the frontend.

## Additional Features Implemented
- **Multi-Language Support**: The app can dynamically switch [languages](https://gnews.io/docs/v4?javascript#languages), filtering news based on the selected language.
- **Dark Mode**: A dark mode toggle is available, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes.
- **Source Links**: Added clickable links to the source of each news article.

## Deployment
The project has been deployed on Vercel, and you can access the live website here:
